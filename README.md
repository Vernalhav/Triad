This project aims to make it easier and more organized to take notes in a tree-like manner!  
  
  
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node JS") and [Express](https://expressjs.com/ "Express").  
  
  
Made with the intent to learn JS/CSS/HTML and client/server interactions, as well as having something I could use. If you see anything that could be improved, feel free to open an Issue and I'll be sure to check it out!
